<h1 id='bueller'>Bueller</h1>

<p>Bueller is a tool for creating and maintaining gems. It&#8217;s meant to be simple and to integrate with <a href='http://gembundler.com'>bundler</a>.</p>

<h2 id='installation'>Installation</h2>

<pre><code>$ gem install bueller</code></pre>

<h2 id='creating'>Creating</h2>

<p>Creating a gem is simple:</p>

<pre><code>$ bueller my_gem</code></pre>

<p>This will create a directory called my_gem with a default gem directory structure. By default, you get a lib/ folder, a Rakefile, and everything you need to start TDDing with <a href='http://rspec.info'>RSpec</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to use other testing libraries, such as Test::Unit, bacon, etc., just pass a command-line option.</p>

<h2 id='maintaining'>Maintaining</h2>

<p>Updating and releasing gems involves a few repetitive tasks that can be automated. Here&#8217;s what a typical workflow looks like:</p>

<pre><code># make updates to your gem
$ git add my_changed_file_1 my_changed_file_2
$ git commit -m &quot;I changed something&quot;
$ rake version:bump:patch
$ rake release</code></pre>

<p>What this does is update your gemspec with a new version number, then releases the gem. A release involves pushing your changes to github, then building the gem and pushing it to rubygems.org.</p>

<h2 id='hey_this_sounds_a_lot_like_jeweler'>Hey, this sounds a lot like Jeweler!</h2>

<p>You&#8217;re right! The codebase originated from Jeweler, but I made a few changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You manage your own gemfile. It&#8217;s no longer defined in the Rakefile. This results in one fewer commit per release and allows you to have a Gemfile that imports requirements from your gemspec (keeping things DRY).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Some unneeded rake tasks were removed, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>rake console</code> - this is better handled by <code>bundle console</code></li>

<li><code>rake gemspec</code> - gemspecs are no longer generated by bueller (except on initial gem creation)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='why_do_you_care_about_bundler_integration'>Why do you care about bundler integration?</h2>

<p>Bundler is great because it allows for easy collaboration. Let&#8217;s say Alice creates a gem called <code>cheshire</code>. Betty wants to make some fixes to <code>cheshire</code>, so she runs:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/alice/cheshire.git
$ bundle &amp;&amp; rake</code></pre>

<p>This grabs the gems needed for running and developing <code>cheshire</code> and runs unit tests. Super simple!</p>
